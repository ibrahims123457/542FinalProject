This algorithm depends on the following packages installed:

python <br/>
numpy<br/>
pandas<br/>
tqdm<br/>
sklearn<br/>


Before running this algorithm, make sure its in the same directory as the file `adult.data` and make sure that files `accuracy.txt`, `accuracy2.txt` exist, since those record results.


To run our project please cd into the project directory, run `python3 KNN.py`, and follow the prompt.

Please make sure to input only integers, the algorithm is NOT build to withstand faulty input.
